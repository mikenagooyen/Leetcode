# Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

# Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

#  Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
# Root Node (3) is always a good node.
# Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
# Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
# Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

# go to a specific X node, and if any node along the path to X node is greater than X, it is not good
# we will use preorder traversal to process the node before we move along with the left and right children
# pass the greatest value we have seen so far to the children and compare with the max value
